    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>Momo is a type of dumpling popular in Nepal, Tibet, and parts of India. It’s made with a thin flour dough wrapper filled with minced meat (like chicken, buffalo, or pork) or vegetables, then steamed or fried. Momos are usually served hot with a spicy dipping sauce called achar. They’re soft, juicy, and one of the most loved street foods in Nepal.</p>
